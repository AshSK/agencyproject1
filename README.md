# Design Agency project - The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp (Udemy)

Day 5 of learning to code - incredibly messy CSS 
Today's project had us editing a website to try to make it responsive as well as doing some editing of the CSS to make it look a little nicer.
This still looks absolutely horrible but for day 5 I don't think I'm doing too badly.

Onwards and upwards.
